I've seen the devil
Down Sunset
In every place
In every face
Yeah, uh, uh
Yeah, uh, uh

Tell me, do you see her? She's livin' her life
Even if she acts like she don't want the limelight
But if you knew her, yeah, she lives a lie
She calls the paparazzi, then she acts surprised, oh
Oh, I know what she needs (oh-oh)

She just want the fame, I know what she fiends (oh-oh)
Give her a little taste, runnin' back to me (oh-oh)
Put it in her veins, pray her soul to keep, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, every night (every night)
She prays to the sky
Flashin' lights
Is all she ever wanted
